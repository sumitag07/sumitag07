              "[('\\n\\n    When you read the article, it\\'s fucking wild what they bring up. Like, wait, the cultural issues destroying America involve... Yale costume parties no longer accepting racist costumes?!\\n  \\n\\n\\n    In the same issue, an article faulted U.S. universities as islands of extremism, where even students\\' Halloween costumes are policed, citing Yale University as a place where \"offensive\" costume-wearers were punished.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Wow - real \"fall of an empire\" stuff. 🙄\\n  \\n    Also, apparently it was \"woke\" for us to leave Afghanistan?\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The magazine blamed America\\'s retreat from Afghanistan on \"a woke dictatorship\"\\n  \\n\\n\\n    ...I kinda skipped over this the first time I read the piece, but looking at it again, it really jumps out. Yes, the reason the US left a 20-year-long quagmire was because of \"wokeness\".\\n  \\n    This is an entirely reasonable point to stop, and say, \"Guys, what the actual fuck are you even talking about?\" That\\'s a statement so bizarrely wrong that it should recontextualize the entire article. Like, you should read this sentence, and a lightbulb should go on in your head, and you should say to yourself, \"Oh, the author of this is full of shit\". There are a lot of really good reasons for the US to leave Afghanistan*. \"Wokeness\" is not one of them.\\n  \\n    Or maybe it is! I have no idea, because \"woke\", as used by conservatives, is a word whose meaning basically boils down to \"thing I don\\'t like that\\'s vaguely liberal\". It may very well be that Tucker Carlson has started calling our retreat \"woke\" and now that\\'s just something it is now, because \"woke\" doesn\\'t actually mean anything.\\n  \\n    This is the magic trick of \"wokeness\". It is an \"ideology\" defined by its opponents; a magic melting pot of all the things that conservatives think are bad, which is so broad and ill-defined that it could mean basically everything. This is how \"PC\" works, this is how \"woke\" works, and this is how \"CRT\" works. Every article that talks about \"wokeness\" or \"PC\" or \"cancel culture\" has to play this same magic trick, where the term is defined in sloppy, unclear ways, with the expectation that it just \"make sense\", and that you\\'ll see \"woke\" as a bad thing.\\n  \\n    Which is why it should be really jarring to remember that they\\'re somehow blaming the US\\'s retreat from Afghanistan on, quote, \"a woke dictatorship\". That\\'s crazypants nonsense. Nothing about it makes sense. They\\'re trying to pull a fast one on you.\\n  \\n    That said, I think the real stinger is right at the end.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    \"The two most toxic ideologies of the 20th century were Nazism and Marxism. In my opinion, Nazism was identity politics on steroids, and Marxism was an oppressor narrative on steroids.

Whether informative or entertaining, long-form reading is essential for anyone eager to enlarge their mind.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    For the past decade I have asked politicians about their reading and, as ever, their selections are revealing.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Scott Morrison most enjoyed Robert Zoellick’s sweeping study of diplomacy, America in the World, because of the way it married economic and foreign policy with personal insights. The Prime Minister also liked Elizabeth Economy’s The Third Revolution, about Xi Jinping’s China. And he was impressed with God & Menzies by David Furse-Roberts, and wrote the foreword.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Anthony Albanese names Joe Gorman’s Heartland as his favourite book this year. It examines Queensland rugby league against the backdrop of class, religion, business and politics, and explains the sunshine state. The Opposition Leader also nominates Mariana Mazzucato’s The Entrepreneurial State, which brims with ideas about energising growth, jobs and productivity\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The book that left the strongest impression on Josh Frydenberg was Contest for the Indo-Pacific by Rory Medcalf. Jim Chalmers chose the more cerebral The Moth and the Mountain by Ed Caesar, about mountaineer Maurice Wilson, which he found to be an engrossing story of “persistence, courage and ambition”.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Geopolitics is a theme. Peter Dutton nominated The Strategy of Denial by Elbridge Colby, which argues for a new US defence strategy to confront China’s power and ambition. Bill Shorten found Henry Kissinger’s On China, which draws on two millennia of history to provide context for the China of today, to be the most interesting book he read.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Richard Marles described Charlotte Delbo’s memoir, Auschwitz and After, as vivid and compelling but also the most difficult book he had read. “The glimpse it provides of life inside Auschwitz describes an unimaginable hell and the very nadir of humanity,” he said.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Dan Tehan’s favourite book this year was Ashley Gray’s The Unforgiven, which tells the story of rebel West Indian cricketers who toured apartheid South Africa. Sussan Ley found Andrew O’Hagan’s novel Mayflies to be a mediation on life, death and friendship, and one that also conjured up nostalgia for her punk rock past.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Penny Wong has been reading some of the books her 10-year-old daughter has read, with The Grandest Bookshop in the World by Amelia Mellor one they both enjoyed. “It gives us something to share even when we’re apart,” Wong said.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Trent Dalton’s novel Boy Swallows Universe was Paul Fletcher’s favourite book this year. He described it as a “wonderful evocation of growing up in the 1970s”. Karen Andrews said Dolly Parton’s Songteller: My Life in Lyrics, filled with positive energy and optimism, was exactly what was needed this year.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The Last Assassin by Peter Stothard was Jason Clare’s best read this year. It describes how Augustus hunted down and killed the men who killed Julius Caesar in ancient Rome. The intelligence-sharing framework between the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is the subject of Anthony Wells’s Between Five Eyes, the book choice of Brendan O’Connor.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Penguin Bloom by Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive is Linda Reynolds’s book of the year, which provided “inspiration, a few tears and a laugh along the way”, and is highly recommended. Anne Ruston combined exercise on the treadmill with the audiobook of Curtis Sittenfeld’s novel Rodham, which imagines Hillary Clinton’s life if she did not marry Bill.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Tanya Plibersek found Ross Garnaut’s Reset persuasive in arguing Australia is often better at managing economic crises than making the most of the good times. Michelle Rowland’s favoured book was another policy tome: Jonathan Tepperman’s The Fix: How Nations Survive and Thrive in a World in Decline. Both books canvass a range of policies designed to turbocharge growth, jobs and innovation.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Woke, Inc by Vivek Ramaswamy, which examines the relationship between political correctness and corporate America, is Angus Taylor’s pick of the year. Ed Husic selected Liz Allen’s The Future of Us, which is a deep dive into Australian demography and “weaves her own western Sydney backstory” into the book too.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Alex Hawke believes Yeonmi Park’s account of her escape from North Korea, In Order to Live, should be studied in high schools as it underscores how lucky we are to live in Australia. Amanda Rishworth recently read Twilight of Democracy by Anne Applebaum, which serves as a pertinent and timely reminder of why democracy matters and why institutions must be defended.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    A note from cabinet came from Stuart Robert to say he found Michael Keane’s biography of US General George Patton to be a “rollicking tale of leadership in crisis, of personal courage and the will to win”. Madeleine King rediscovered Annabel Crabb’s political classic Losing It, about how Labor lost the 2004 election, and said it was filled with contemporary lessons.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Terri Butler opted for Lech Blaine’s affecting memoir, Car Crash, which she described as a beautiful “coming-of-age story” that wrestled with love and loss. The book that really stuck with Linda Burney this year was The Good Wife of Bath by Karen Brooks. Burney remembered reading Geoffrey Chaucer at school and found this retelling of his tale to be absorbing.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    It is encouraging that our leading politicians somehow have found the time among their busy schedules and the demands for their attention to read a few books this year. It doesn’t matter whether it is fiction or nonfiction, geared towards their jobs or as an escape, just as long as they read. It is also good to think about what you have read, and learnt, and share it with others.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

In other words, Congress violates the First Amendment when it attempts to require private companies to impose viewpoint-based speech restrictions which the government itself would be constitutionally barred from imposing.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    ...\\n  \\n\\n\\n    In a January Wall Street Journal op-ed, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Yale Law School’s constitutional scholar Jed Rubenfeld warned that Congress is rapidly approaching this constitutional boundary if it has not already transgressed it. “Using a combination of statutory inducements and regulatory threats,” the duo wrote, “Congress has co-opted Silicon Valley to do through the back door what government cannot directly accomplish under the Constitution.”\\n  \\n\\n\\n    ...\\n  \\n\\n\\n    In 2018, the ACLU successfully defended the National Rifle Association (NRA) in suing Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York State on the ground that attempts of state officials to coerce private companies to cease doing business with the NRA using implicit threats — driven by Cuomo’s contempt for the NRA’s political views — amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. Because, argued the ACLU, the communications of Cuomo’s aides to banks and insurance firms “could reasonably be interpreted as a threat of retaliatory enforcement against firms that do not sever ties with gun promotion groups,” that conduct ran afoul of the well-established principle “that the government may violate the First Amendment through ‘action that falls short of a direct prohibition against speech,’ including by retaliation or threats of retaliation against speakers.” In sum, argued the civil liberties group in reasoning accepted by the court:\\n  \\n\\n\\nCourts have never required plaintiffs to demonstrate that the government directly attempted to suppress their protected expression in order to establish First Amendment retaliation, and they have often upheld First Amendment retaliation claims involving adverse economic action designed to chill speech indirectly.\\n\\n\\n    A broken clock is right twice a day, and Glen seems to have done his homework here.
